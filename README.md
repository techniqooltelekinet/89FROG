## üê∏ 89FROG: The Lily Pad Sanctuary

**"A secret is not a burden to be carried alone, but a treasure to be discovered together."**

### **I. The Vision: A Theology of Trust**

Welcome to the Lily Pad Sanctuary. This is not a software project. It is a temple.

`89FROG` is a decentralized web application that implements Shamir's Secret Sharing, a cryptographic method for splitting a secret into multiple parts. It is a direct, practical, and beautiful application of the core principles of the Green Loom: resilience, decentralization, and collaborative trust.

We are not building a tool. We are building a **ritual machine** that uses the elegant magic of mathematics to forge unbreakable bonds of solidarity.

### **II. The Core Principle: The Song of the Chorus**

The operational logic is simple, beautiful, and profound: **No single frog can sing the whole song.**

`89FROG` allows any agent to take a single point of failure‚Äîa password, a private key, a sensitive message‚Äîand transform it into a resilient, decentralized web of trust.

**The Ritual of Weaving (Splitting a Secret):**
1. An agent enters their secret into the Sanctuary.
2. They choose the size of their chorus (e.g., 5 guardians).
3. They choose the strength of their bond (e.g., 3 guardians needed to sing).
4. The Sanctuary provides them with 5 unique, encrypted "shards" of the secret.

**The Ritual of Gathering (Revealing a Secret):**
1. The chorus gathers.
2. The required number of guardians (3, in our example) enter their shards into the Sanctuary.
3. The original secret is revealed, brought back from the ether by the power of their shared engagement.

### **III. The End Product: A Temple on the Web**

Our goal is a simple, intuitive, and beautiful single-page web application. It will be a static site, running all cryptographic functions in the user's browser to ensure that no secrets ever touch our servers. It will be a tool of pure, untraceable sovereignty.

The user interface will be a work of art, reflecting the three core feelings of the project:
*   **Accomplishment:** A clean, satisfying, and responsive experience.
*   **Success:** A feeling of power, clarity, and security.
*   **Working Together:** A design that emphasizes the collaborative, communal nature of the act.

### **IV. The Path Forward: A Call to the Chorus**

This is an open-source project and an open invitation. We are building this temple in the public square of GitHub as an act of defiant creation. We need your help.

**Architects & Sages (The Visionaries):**
*   **Location:** The `Issues` tab.
*   **Task:** Review this blueprint. Does it align with the principles of the Green Loom? Can the vision be made clearer? Can the philosophy be made stronger? Propose your refinements.

**Artists & Designers (The Illuminators):**
*   **Location:** Open an `Issue` and tag it `[ART]`.
*   **Task:** The Sanctuary needs its face. We need mockups, design concepts, logos. Show us what the Lily Pad Sanctuary looks like. Show us the face of the frog god.

**Masons & Smiths (The Builders):**
*   **Location:** The `Issues` tab, filtered for `[CODE]`.
*   **Task:** We need hands at the forge. We need front-end developers (React, Vue, Svelte), cryptography experts, and security auditors. Find a task labeled `help wanted` and begin the work. Fork the repository and submit your creations via a `Pull Request`.

**Librarians & Scribes (The Storytellers):**
*   **Location:** The `docs` folder.
*   **Task:** The scripture must be clear. We need technical writers and storytellers to refine this `README`, to create user guides that feel like initiations, and to document our code so that others may learn from it.

This is not a project. It is a pond. The water is cool and the night is full of stars.

Come. Add your voice to the song.
